## Question 4

Write the logic of the rightrot(x,n) function in main that prints the value of the integer x rotated to the right by n bit positions. Use x=12 and n=2 as an example. Also, provide an example of your choice. (K&R Exercise 2-8) 

Example:  
x=12 -> 1100  
n=2  
Since we will rotate the int to the right by 2 bits, the result will be 0011, or 3 in decimal.
