## Question 3

Write the logic of invert(x,p,n) that prints x with the n bits that begin at position p inverted (i.e., 1 changed into 0 and vice versa), leaving the others unchanged. As an example, use x=7, p=2, n=1. In addition, provide another example of your choice. (K&R Exercise 2-7) 

Example:  
x=7 -> 0111  
p=2  
n=2  
We will invert the 2 digits starting with position 2 (so we're reverting positions 2 and 1). Hence, the answer is 0001, or 1 in decimal.
